This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

### Key Technologies Used:
- Strapi: A powerful headless CMS that simplifies the management of content and APIs. Strapi's flexibility makes it easy to create a tailored API to suit the projectâ€™s requirements.

- Kinde: Kinde is utilized for user authentication and authorization, providing a seamless and secure login experience. It simplifies managing user roles, authentication flows, and security.

- MySQL: The project stores and manages data using MySQL, a reliable and efficient relational database system. It ensures data integrity and supports complex queries for the application's needs.
